<P> Our project is CyberSurge, a minimalist, cross-platform mobile RTS game that can be played on 
iPhone and Android devices.  Our main motivation behind CyberSurge is to bring the RTS experience 
from the computer to the mobile phone.  RTS stands for real time strategy and it encompasses all 
strategy games that take progress in real time rather than in turns like chess.  RTS games have 
become extremely popular genre on computers and include famous examples such as Age of Empire and
StarCraft.  However, RTS games can be extremely difficult for the average player to learn since 
the game can have hundreds of units and need multiple hours to understand the basic game mechanics.
Therefore, we created CyberSurge which takes the core ideas of a RTS game and puts them into a 
mobile device.  In CyberSurge your objective is to conquer the enemies base using units that are 
controlled with streamlines and intuitive controls.  At the same time you are trying to outsmart 
your enemy you must be on the lookout for attacks on your base.  The game takes place on a 
leisurely pace, 5-10 minute matches, and can be played against strangers and friends.
